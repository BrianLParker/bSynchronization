# bSynchronization

This is a Blazor component for Synchronization that supports two-way messaging between clients and server.

## Summary

This is a Blazor Library to provide engineers with Blazor components that enables them to develop software with two-way messaging capabilities.

The main idea here is to provide a payload-agnostic communication component.

The library should support:
- Message group isolation.
- Message type isolation.
- Avoid UI implementation rather just demonstrate how to use the service context(s) it provides.

Demonstrate:
- Chat Page â€“ Room support, private
- Remote dialog launching. (Modals, Toasts etc)
- API data synchronization (event driven design)

Ideally, this product is built to improve the engineering experience for developing communications components in Blazor.

For any questions or inquiries about this component please contact the following engineers:
